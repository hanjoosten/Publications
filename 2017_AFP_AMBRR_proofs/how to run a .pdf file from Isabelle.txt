Running a pdf from an Isabelle theory:

1. In Microsoft Explorer, I went to the directory that contains the Isabelle executables. This directory is called Isabelle2016-1.
(I found it by searching for Isabelle2016-1 in the file system. It was on "C:\Users\sjo\AppData\Roaming\local\bin\Isabelle2016-1")
I checked that it contains a file Cygwin-Terminal.bat

2. I called the file "Cygwin-Terminal.bat" by double-clicking it.
This opens a command-line interpreter (CLI), which is the GNU Bash interpreter of Cygwin.

3. In this CLI, I navigated to the directory that contains my Isabelle source code, "Increments.sty", by issuing the command
$ cd /cygdrive/d/git/Publications/2017\ AFP\ AMBRR\ proofs
I used the command "ls -al" to verify that this directory contains my Isabelle source code file "Increments.thy".

4. I generated a pdf-file "D:\git\Publications\2017 APF AMBRR proofs\output\document\root.pdf" by calling Isabelle:
$ isabelle build -D .
I checked the result in Microsoft Explorer and displayed it with my pdf-viewer.
